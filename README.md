>  Reiterating: I’m not looking for a comprehensive overview but more of a “here is what you need to
know to deliver minimum functionality with this component”
<br> We will determine how to style this formally based on the outcome of our GIT projects.
That said – minimalistic and clear is ideal: Simple headers, paragraphs, and images will suffice, along
with some basic layout work (margin, padding, etc).

## Key Points
- Introduction to React and its importance in the MERN stack.
    - 
- Setting up a React project (create-react-app).
    - install node js <link>
    - in terminal navigate to directory and run ` npx create-react-app [app-name] `
    - if you get a 404 error, run `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` and rerun ` npx create-react-app [app-name] ` to make sure the newest verison is installed correctly
    - it will propmt to install neccessary packages - enter `y` and it will install them and create the app, this might take a few minutes
    - run `cd [app-name]` to navigate to the app's directory
    - run `npm start` to open your web app on a local server
    - the page is populated with defualt files that will can edit to create your app
    - if you want to create an empty app, without all the files create-react-app installs, you can create your folder and populate the files yourself
        - [[ file organization and neccessary files ]]
        -  w node + npm installed, run `npm start`
- Dependencies
    - packages that are used in the react project
    - listed in the packages-lock.json file
    - [[ how to intall and use ]]
    - [[ example ]]
- Components, props, and state management.
    - components are independant resuable bits of code that return HTML.
- Hooks and lifecycle methods.
     -
